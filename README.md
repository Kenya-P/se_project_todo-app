# Simple Todo App

The Simple Todo App is a user-friendly design to assist users with planning out simple tasks at any given time. The user can add new todos with the option of a due date to the list of tasks as well as remove them. Also, there is a checkbox available to mark each todo when completed.

## Functionality

<!--Give a more detailed explanation of the project and its functionality.-->

Upon access to the app, there is a list of to-do tasks implemented by the user. Any new task can be added via the "Add Todo" button. When activating the button a popup form will appear. This form contains two input elements for both the name and date of the task the user may want to add. Although, the date is optional; each new todo requires a name. After, adding all the necessary fields the create button is active to submit the new todo; which will then be promptly added to the end of the list. Each to-do task is paired with a delete function and a checkbox. The delete function will remove the todo from the list and the checkbox is available to mark a todo task as complete.
